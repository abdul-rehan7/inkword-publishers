# Email Configuration for Contact Form
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual email credentials

# Your email address (the one sending the emails)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com

# Your email password or app password (for Gmail, use an app password)
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Gmail SMTP settings (default in the code)
# If using a different email provider, you may need to update the SMTP settings in the API route

# For Gmail:
# 1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
# 2. Generate an "App Password" specifically for this application
# 3. Use that app password as EMAIL_PASS (not your regular Gmail password)

# For other email providers, you'll need to update the SMTP settings in:
# app/api/contact/route.ts

# Replace 'contact@inkwordpublishers.com' in the API route with your actual business email
